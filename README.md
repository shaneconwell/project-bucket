  ## Description
  MERN STACK APPLICATION -    B*ucket is a social media site with the goal of connecting like-minded individuals and helping them check off their bucket list items (called Campaigns). Each user can create multiple Campaigns - each for a different item on their list. Each Campaign will have a title, description, location, timeframe, and possible funding goal as well. Users will be able to add updates to their Campaigns along the way - as well as marking them complete once they have accomplished their goal - or checked that item off their ‘bucket list’. Our goal is to allow users to follow each other in order to be presented with their new Campaigns and Campaign updates. We would also like to implement a map where users can drop pins for the locations of each of their items - such as seeing the Pyramids in Egypt or whatever location-dependent bucket list item. This would, hopefully, allow users to check bucket list items off together and make genuine connections - either in their hometowns or on the road. The main purpose of this project is to provide a more human social media experience, connecting people based on their life goals/bucket list items - hopefully creating lasting friendships and a supportive community along the way.
